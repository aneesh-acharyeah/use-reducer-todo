# 📝 React To-Do List with useReducer

This is a simple yet functional To-Do List application built using **React** and the `useReducer` hook. It demonstrates how to manage complex state and handle user interactions like adding, toggling, and removing tasks.

## 🚀 Features

- ✅ Add new tasks
- 🔄 Toggle task completion
- ❌ Remove tasks
- 🧠 Built using `useReducer` for scalable and maintainable state logic

## 🧩 What is `useReducer`?

`useReducer` is a React hook that helps manage more complex state than `useState` — particularly when state depends on previous state or when actions are more structured. It's like a simpler alternative to Redux for component-level state.

### Why use `useReducer`?

- Clean separation of state logic
- Better for managing multiple related state updates
- Ideal when you have complex update flows (like a to-do app)
